# ARC Raiders Progress Tracker

This project is a responsive single-page application for planning and tracking
progress in **ARC Raiders**. It is built with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla
JavaScript and persists state locally via `localStorage`.

## Project structure

```
.
├── index.html   # Application shell and layout
├── styles.css   # Light/dark themes, responsive layout, and animations
└── app.js       # Modular application logic for workshop, quests, and skills
```

## Features

- Sticky header with smooth-scrolling navigation between the Workshop, Quest
  Log, and Skill Tree sections.
- Theme toggle with light/dark palettes, transitions, and persistence.
- Workshop upgrade tracking with per-material progress bars and totals.
- Quest management with search, trader filters, completion tracking, and
  persistence.
- Skill planner with tooltips/modals, point tracking, and warnings when the
  limit is exceeded.
- Import/export JSON backups and in-app notifications for completion events.

## Running locally

Open `index.html` directly in a browser or serve the repository with a static
file server (for example, `npx http-server`). All data is stored in the
browser, so no backend is required.

## Deployment

To publish the tracker, host the repository on any static hosting provider
such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. Ensure the three project files are
present in the repository root before deploying.
