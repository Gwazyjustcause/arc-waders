# ARC Raiders Progress Tracker

This project is a responsive single-page application for planning and tracking
progress in **ARC Raiders**. It is built with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla
JavaScript and persists state locally via `localStorage`.

## Project structure

```
.
├── index.html   # Application shell and layout
├── styles.css   # Light/dark themes, responsive layout, and animations
└── app.js       # Modular application logic for workshop, quests, and skills
```

## Features

- Sticky header with smooth-scrolling navigation between the Workshop, Quest
  Log, and Skill Tree sections.
- Theme toggle with light/dark palettes, transitions, and persistence.
- Workshop upgrade tracking with per-material progress bars and totals.
- Quest management with search, trader filters, completion tracking, and
  persistence.
- Skill planner with tooltips/modals, point tracking, and warnings when the
  limit is exceeded.
- Import/export JSON backups and in-app notifications for completion events.

## Running locally

You can open `index.html` directly in a browser or run a lightweight static
server so that in-app navigation and imports behave exactly as they would in
production.

### Option 1 — Open the file directly

1. Locate `index.html` in the project folder.
2. Double-click it or open it from your browser via **File → Open File…**.
3. All progress is stored in the browser, so no additional setup is required.

### Option 2 — Serve with `npx http-server`

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. From the project root, run:

   ```bash
   npx http-server -p 8080
   ```

   The `-p 8080` flag chooses a port—feel free to pick any open port.
3. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. Progress is stored in the
   browser’s `localStorage`, so no backend setup is required.

You can use any other static file server (for example, `python -m http.server`)
if you prefer a different tool.

## Deployment

To publish the tracker, host the repository on any static hosting provider
such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. Ensure the three project files are
present in the repository root before deploying.

## Syncing your changes with GitHub

If updates are not appearing on GitHub, double-check that the local repository
is connected to a remote and that your latest commits have been pushed.

1. Verify the remote:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   If nothing is listed, add the remote with:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-user>/<your-repo>.git
   ```

2. Commit any pending changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your update"
   ```

3. Push to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

   For GitHub Pages sites, ensure you push to the branch configured for
   deployment (commonly `main`, `master`, or `gh-pages`). Once the push
   completes, GitHub will rebuild and serve the updated files.
